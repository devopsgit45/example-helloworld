Quick Start
Open in Gitpod

If you decide to open in Gitpod then refer to README-gitpod.md, otherwise continue reading.

The following dependencies are required to build and run this example, depending on your OS, they may already be installed:

Install node (v14 recommended)

Install Rust v1.56.1 or later from https://rustup.rs/
Install Solana v1.8.14 or later from https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
If this is your first time using Rust, these Installation Notes might be helpful.

Configure CLI
If you're on Windows, it is recommended to use WSL to run these commands

Set CLI config url to localhost cluster
solana config set --url localhost
Create CLI Keypair
If this is your first time using the Solana CLI, you will need to generate a new keypair:

solana-keygen new
Start local Solana cluster
This example connects to a local Solana cluster by default.

Start a local Solana cluster:

solana-test-validator
Note: You may need to do some system tuning (and rest
